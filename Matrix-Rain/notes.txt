fillText()
    ctx.fillText(text,x,y)

createLinearGradient()
    ctx.createLinearGradient(startX,startY,endX,endY);

    let gradient = ctx.createLinearGradient(0,0,canvas.width,canvas.height)
    gradient.addColorStop(0,"rgba(225,25,50,.25)") //assignColors 
    ....
    gradient.addColorStop(1,"rgba(225,25,50,0.2)")

createRadialGradient()
    ctx.createRadialGradient(x1,y1,r1,x2,y2,r2);
    1-inner_circle
    2-outer-circle

font
    ctx.font='px monospace'
    -ctx.font property specifies the current text style

monospace: fonts have characters that occupy the same amount of horizontal space

Delta Time Technique:
    -delta time is the difference between frames and milliseconds


PROCEDURAL programming
    declare variables and functions step by step in the order I want them to be executed;

Object Oriented Programming-(OOP)
    wrap function and variables in Objects

    JavaScript Class
        it is a special kind of function used to create many similar objects / you can also call it a blueprint
        Class Syntaxt
            it is relatively new, it was introduced in 2015 and it's just so-called 'SYNTACTICAL SUGAR' (simplified syntaxt) built in native Javascript Prototype functionality
        Methods
            Methods are functions in class
        Private Methods
            Private Methods cannot be called directly from outside, they have restricted access
        ::constructor is called when we instantiate class by using the new keyword
    4 main principles of OOP:
        1)Encapsulation    
            - wrapping variables and related functions that operate on them in objects
        2)Abstraction
            -hiding unnecessary details from the users
            -Abstraction is about hiding internal functionality and implementation details of our objects and only exposing essential information to user.
        3)Inheritance
        4)Polymorphism
